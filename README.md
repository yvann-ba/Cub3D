# Cub3d

## 📜 Description
"Cub3d" is a graphical project from 42 School that involves creating a simple 3D game using the raycasting technique. The project requires building a 3D world from a 2D map using raycasting to simulate a first-person perspective. It emphasizes mastery of rendering, event handling, and 2D/3D transformations.
